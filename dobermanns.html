            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dobermanns, or Doberman Pinschers, were first bred in Germany by a tax collector named Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann. They were bred to be very protective, which they are! There are several dogs breeds that were bred to make the Dobermann, some of which are the Rottweiler, German Pinscher, Great Dane, German Shepherd, Manchester Terrier, and Greyhound.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dobermanns are very loyal, extremely intelligent, and outgoing. Although, they can sometimes be stubborn. Dobermanns used to be used as guard dogs many years ago due to their loyalty and somewhat "intimidating" appearance. Sometimes, owners will crop their Dobermann's ears to give them a more fierce look. Because of this and their past, people are often scared of Dobermanns and tend to not buy them. However, with care, Dobermanns are sweet and easy to train.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dobermanns require a lot of exercise, so either a fenced in yard or a walk everyday is necessary to keep them healthy. It may also be a good idea to take your Dobermann to your local dog park. However, if you do decide to take your dog to the park, it is very important to introduce them to other dogs when they are young so that they are friendly.</p>
